- INITIAL DD REVIEW
  - renamed some route names
  - honestly nothing else was needed based on feedback
- added heading and roster in README
- desc README

isabelZ -- 2025-12-04 11:44
- added TriviaAPI card and description in keys

jasonC -- 2025-12-05 11:23
- wrote rundown of Bored API
- transferred over everyone's work on API rundowns onto readme (which isabel says it's wrong oops)

AoanulH -- 2025-12-05 11:30
- Set up basic requirements.txt (will add needed dependencies once project is completed)

MayaB -- 2025-12-07 16:51
 - Finished middleware (started yesterday but left in some useless stuff)
 - Decided to remove bio and signup date fields from table, updated middleware and design doc
 - Tested to make sure everything in data.py works

jasonC -- 2025-12-07 11:13
- wrote login, register, and home pages
  - they semi-work (works without errors) but is missing quite a few things, which i'll do later
  - for the most part, IT'S A WORKING APP!

jasonC -- 2025-12-09 11:04
- yesterday, i worked on getting login page and account database stuff working
- still work in progress

AoanulH -- 2025-12-09 11:17
- Worked on Trivia Page (generating the question (needs improvements))
- Updated __init__.py to decode the json from the trivia api

MayaB -- 2025-12-09 11:38
- Fixed up my url error handling to actually work :) plain but it's something
- Removed some unnecessary stuff from data.py (main script)

AoanulH -- 2025-12-09 11:46
- Finished displaying all trivia question info (answer choices, category, question, difficulty)

jasonC -- 2025-12-10 06:35
- completed login/register page with errors and database stuff
- added navbar

AoanulH -- 2025-12-10 11:47
- Added conditional statments to trivia.html (if its true/false questions display only two choices, vice versa)

AoanulH -- 2025-12-10 9:44
- Optimization and formatting fixes
- Worked on javscript in trivia.html (shuffling of answers via a simple for loop using math.random, and utilizing alert() to alert users if they're answer is right (temp))

isabelZ -- 2025-12-11 01:09
- Worked on including the JokesAPI question database
- Edited the HTML file accordingly (separated the two-part and single line jokes)

jasonC -- 2025-12-11 11:07
- worked on css stuff and kinda struggled

jasonC -- 2025-12-12 6:37
- finally got css working, experimented with different styles

AoanulH -- 2025-12-12 11:45
- Changed alert() to innerHTML to display if you're incorrect or correct
- Added a next button that utilizes post to retrieve the next question
- Started current score (doesn't work,but will soon)

AoanulH -- 2025-12-14 5:03
- replaced java script conditionals to jinja2 conditionals because it is much easier
- Added difficulty section (easy, medium, hard)
- Made it so once user answers they can't click any other answer choices and must move on or refresh the page (for a different question)
- Improved the backend  (__init__.py) for error handling. API has a 5 second rate limit, so I added a cooldown + generating batches of questions instead  of 1 (might need to fix something with refreshing the page).
- Fixed score, but still haven't connected it to the data.

jasonC -- 2025-12-14 23:04
- created first navbar on home page
 - haven't polished it yet so i'm not pasting it on the other pages yet
 - if the username is >55 characters long, it will extend the webpage to the right and it looks ugly

jasonC -- 2025-12-16 6:49
- styling trivia work in progress
- navbar improvements
- trying to figure out a css file to get fonts working?
