Trivia API does not require a sign-in to generate a key, and instead, allows the user to generate a key based on the desired difficulty, category, and type of questions. 
With these selections, each API link would be unique; in this format: https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=<QUESTION NUMBER>&category=<CATEGORY CODE>&difficulty=<LEVEL>&type= <MULTIPLECHOICE/TRUEFALSE>
It allows 100,000 calls per month, but is limited to 11,000 questions. In order to avoid repeated questions, each session must be connected to a token, which would deactivate after 6 hours of inactivity. 
The API will run on one continuous session that will track the last usage, and we will be able to use the category ID, question ID, and global question databases.
